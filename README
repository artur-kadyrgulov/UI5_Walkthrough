Step 0: Preparation.
    - Create app root folder. In my case it is 'UI5_WALKRTHROUGH'.
    - Go to the created folder.
    - Open terminal and execute 'npm install --global @ui5/cli'.

Step 1: Hello World.
    - Created index.html
    - Created manifext.json
        The manifest.json file defines static information about the application, such as the name of the application or the location of various files.
