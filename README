Application created based on the tutorial 'Walkthrough Tutorial' UI5 

Step 0: Preparation.
    - Create app root folder. In my case it is 'UI5_WALKRTHROUGH'.
    - Go to the created folder.
    - Open terminal and execute 'npm install --global @ui5/cli'.

Step 1: Hello World.
    - Created index.html
    - Created manifext.json
        The manifest.json file defines static information about the application, such as the name of the application or the location of various files.

    - Execute 'npm i -D @ui5/cli' to install UI Tooling.
    - Execute 'ui5 init'.
    - Execute 'npm start'.

Step 2: Bootstrap.
    - Open a terminal from the app root folder. 
    - Execute 'ui5 use OpenUI5'.
    - Execute 'ui5 add sap.ui.core sap.m themelib_sap_horizon'.
    - We tell SAPUI5 taht resources in the kadyrgulov.walkthrough are located in the same folder as index.html

Step 5. Controllers
    - It's about Controllers

    - Be careful when specifying the name of the view. Controllers carry the same name as the related view (if there is a 1:1 relationship)
